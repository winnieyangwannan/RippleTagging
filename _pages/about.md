How does the brain select what to consolidate during sleep? Our new work sheds light on the brain's mechanism for selective
memory consolidation.
We propose that awake ripples act as a memory tag üè∑Ô∏è-- the memories that are tagged by awake ripples are selectively consolidated
during sleep!

Using dual sided probes, we were able to record up to 500 neurons simultaneously while animals perform an alternation task on
the figure-8 maze.

UMAP visualization revealed that population activity of the hippocampus corresponded to a latent space that topologically
resembled the physical environment. This visual, though beautiful, was not surprising since hippocampus is known to keep
a ‚Äòcognitive map‚Äô of the world.

What was really unexpected was when we colored the neural manifold by trial number, we  saw the hippocampal states systematically 
vary according to trial sequence.

As per Heraclitus, ‚ÄúNo man ever steps in the same river twice. For it‚Äôs not the same river and he‚Äôs not the same man.‚Äù 
Even as the animal revisits the same places, the brain state is never the same twice, always in perpetual flux, changing
in a systematic way. ‚è≥

When animals consume reward, synchronous population events, aka sharp wave ripples, usually take place. Ripples are known to
'replay' past experiences. Crucially,  we were able to decode not only which places were replayed 
but also which lap events were replayed. 


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/about/awake_replay_7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

During NREM sleep üò¥, ripples resume their activity. Are awake ripples related to those during subsequent sleep (post-sleep)? 
We compared their population activities.



<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/about/sleep_replay_8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The distribution patterns of trial identity during post-sleep were highly correlated with that during maze replay, but not
with pre-sleep replay. Mixed-effect linear regression analysis confirmed that post-sleep replay patterns were best explained 
by that during awake replay. The trials that were replayed more during awake ripples were selectively consolidated more 
during sleep!!

We replicated our main conclusions using 4 different methods ‚Äì including decoding from the original high dimensional space
using different distance metrics, decoding from UMAP low-dimensional embedding, as well as PCA space.

    </div>
</div>

Taken together, our results suggest that awake ripples act as a memory tag. Experience tagged by the awake ripples are 
selectively consolidated numerous times during sleep.
