  title={Selection of experience for memory by hippocampal sharp wave ripples},
  author={Yang, Wannan and Sun, Chen and Huszár, Roman and Hainmueller, Thomas and Buzsáki,György},
  abstract={Experiences need to be tagged during learning for further consolidation. However, neurophysiological mechanisms that select experiences for lasting memory are not known. Combining large-scale neural recordings with dimensionality reduction techniques, we observed that successive maze traversals were tracked by continuously drifting populations of neurons, providing neuronal signatures of both places visited and events encountered. When the brain state changed during reward consumption, sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) occurred on some trials and their unique spike content decoded the trial blocks that surrounded them. During post-experience sleep, SPW-Rs continued to replay those trial blocks that were reactivated most frequently during waking SPW-Rs. Replay content of awake SPW-Rs may thus provide a neurophysiological tagging mechanism to select aspects of experience that are preserved and consolidated for future use.},
